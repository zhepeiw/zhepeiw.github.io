        <p> Hello, this is Zhepei's page. I am a researcher at the MusicAI Group of Adobe Research. I am particularly interested in the applications of machine learning in music, audio and speech processing, including sound synthesis, sound recognition, source separation, speech enhancement, and multi-modal representation learning. </p> 

        <p> Before joining Adobe, I was an applied scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS) for both full-time and several internship experiences, solving customer problems on real-time speech enhancement and enterprise search. I earned my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at the <b>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</b> (UIUC) in 2023, advised by Professor <a class="item__header" href="https://paris.cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Paris Smaragdis</a>. Prior to my Ph.D. program, I obtained my B.S. in computer science from <b> Harvey Mudd College </b> in May 2018.</p>

      <p> Feel free to checkout my <a href="/assets/cv.pdf" target="_blank"> academic CV </a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user={{ site.author.scholar }}" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{site.author.linkedin}}" target="_blank"> LinkedIn </a> profile. </p>


      <p> I'm recently getting trained as a pop singer. I'm also an enthusiastic fan of classical music, an amateur piano player, a licensed bartender, and a tennis player.</p>
